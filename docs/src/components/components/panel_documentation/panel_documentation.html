    <h4>To add or remove a role</h4>
    <p>Only Space Managers have permission to change these roles. To change a role,
       click a checkbox and wait a moment for the request to process, then see
       what happens:
     </p>
     <ul>
       <li>
         If you tried adding a role and this was successful, the checkbox will become checked (and you won’t get an error message).
       </li>
       <li>
         If you tried adding a role but didn’t have permission, the checkbox won’t update.
       </li>
       <li>
         If you tried removing a role and this was successful, the checkbox will become unchecked (and you won’t get an error message).
       </li>
       <li>
         If you tried removing a role but didn’t have permission, the checkbox will become unchecked and you’ll get an error message (“You are not authorized to perform the requested action”).
       </li>
     </ul>
