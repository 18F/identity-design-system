# A bit about 18Franklin

**18Franklin** was developed by 18F as a fork of **Libre Franklin**. It has some significant and some subtle differences from its parent font. It should be suitable for reading or for headings, but cloud.gov uses it mostly for dashboard UI.

 The typeface is under active development in 2016 and 2017. Get most recent version or contribute to its development at [https://github.com/18F/18franklin](https://github.com/18F/18franklin).
