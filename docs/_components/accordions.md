{% include helpers/base-component.html component="accordion" %}

Before using an accordion, consider if their use would hinder usability. If there is not enough content to warrant condensing or if visitors need to see most or all of the information on a page, use well-formatted text instead.

In the examples below, replace `<h2>` with the appropriate heading level to maintain the document's outline.

## Default

{% include helpers/embed.html embed="accordions/default" %}

## Bordered

{% include helpers/embed.html embed="accordions/bordered" %}
