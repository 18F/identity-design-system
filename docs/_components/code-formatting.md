  Facilitates syntax highlighting that maintains visually consistency with the login.gov color palette
---

Intended for use by other developers when producing documentation for sites that leverage the login.gov style guide,
such as this one, we expose a collection of helper classes designed to be used with a
pygments-compatible syntax highlighter. Examples of these include [peacock](https://github.com/thlorenz/peacock),
for JavaScript, or [rouge](https://github.com/jneen/rouge), for ruby; the latter of which jekyll depends on.

The class names provided map directly to a subset of classnames generated by any pygment-compatible highlighter
during parsing, and should therefore not be used directly.

For a list of supported token, see the syntax highlighting [in the scss file](https://github.com/18F/identity-style-guide/blob/master/src/scss/components/_code.scss).

These classes should provide functional highlighting for any of the languages Pygments supports.
For a complete list of tokens, and for more general information on Pygments, please refer to the [pygments documentation](http://pygments.org/).
