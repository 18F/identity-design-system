## Alert Usage

In the application user interface, alerts should be used whenever a user initiates an action and returns to the same place once the action is complete or fails.

If the action is part of a flow, meaning the user will advance to another step or fail out, a separate screen or view should be used to indicate success of failure.

Visit the [USWDS Alerts component](https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/alert/) page for more information and usage examples
