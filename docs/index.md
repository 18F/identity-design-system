# Installation and usage

Install with `npm`:

```
npm install identity-style-guide
```

There are no dependencies, and the `npm` module includes production-ready minified CSS, images, fonts, and JavaScript (as well as source files if you’d prefer to build them in your application’s build pipeline).
